## Description
This project features a golfer swinging his club at a ball. Users can interact with the project in two simple ways. When the page loads, viewers can choose to play the GIF to watch the golf swing in motion. This can be done through touching the upper part of the screen. After observing the animation, users can draw a line on the lower part of the screen to predict the trajectory of the ball after impact. Once it is drawn, the program calculates how close the userâ€™s prediction is to the actual path of the ball and displays a percentage score for accuracy.
